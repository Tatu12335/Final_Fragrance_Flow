✈️ Work in progress!

  • Right now working on learning asp.net core to make this project into a web app. I have little bit of background in html,css and 
    javascript.

  
  • Update, i learned js and react, so now i start to work on the frontend of my web version. At the same time, im doing a wpf-version. Im sorry for the lack of documentation at this point.
    I plan on making a change to that.
